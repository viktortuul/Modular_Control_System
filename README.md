# Modular_Control_System
The basis for this project is in a developed networked control system simulation environment created in C# which allow for studying attack and defence mechanism. Several modules which each has critical components make up the whole system. Section \ref{sec:HMI_Module} presents the \textit{Human Machine Interface} (HMI) module which correspond to the control center where the rest of the system can be monitored and managed. Then in Section \ref{sec:Control_Module} the \textit{Control Module} is presented which produces the actuator signals to control the plant. Section \ref{sec:Plant_Module} introduces the \textit{Plant Module} which is a simulated dynamical process which the experiments are conducted on. Then Section \ref{sec:Canal_Module} shows the \textit{Channel Module} which can be considered as a router which routes traffic between the other modules. This is also where many of the conduced attacks takes place.

An overview of the modular control system is presented below, where two communication channels enable communication between the modules.
