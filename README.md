# Modular_Control_System
This project is conducted at the department of automatic control at KTH, Stockholm. The project is to develop a simulation environment for a modular and networked control system. The purpose of the simulation environment is to realistically study attack and defence mechanisms, both well known and to develop new ones. Several modules make up the whole system and are each described in sections below. In total there are four modules: HMI, Control, Plant, and Channel.

An overview of the modular control system is presented below, where two communication channels enable communication between the modules. The system can be scaled up as an arbitrary number of plants can be controlled in parallel from one single HMI, illustrated in the figure.
