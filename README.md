# Modular_Control_System
The basis for this project is in a developed networked control system simulation environment created in C# which allow for studying attack and defence mechanism. Several modules make up the whole system and are each described in sections below. In total there are four modules: HMI, Control, Plant, and Channel.

An overview of the modular control system is presented below, where two communication channels enable communication between the modules.

The system can also by scaled up as an arbitrary number of plants can be controlled in parallel from one single HMI, illustrated below.
